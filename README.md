# ML Fundamentals  
Some exercises on the fundamentals of Machine Learning, as taught by Dr Chico Camargo at the University of Exeter.  

# Requirements  
The csv files necessary for the code are in the releases section of this repo.  
Additionally, the following libraries are necessary:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn notebook
```
